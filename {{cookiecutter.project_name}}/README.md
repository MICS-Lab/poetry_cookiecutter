# Instructions

This project has been generated by cookicutter from [this template](https://github.com/MICS-Lab/poetry_cookiecutter).

## Activate the poetry environment

To activate your new poetry environment, you can choose one of the following:
- Choose the installed poetry interpreter on VSCode (it activate your env automatically at each new terminal window).
- At the root of the project, run `poetry shell`.
- Use `poetry run` before each command line, e.g. `poetry run python your_script.py`

## Run the documentation locally

`mkdocs serve`

### Deploy the doc
To deploy the documentation on Github Pages, you need first to push a new tag (choose a `tag-name` that starts with `v`):
```
git tag <tag-name>
git push origin <tag-name>
```
Then, go to the github settings, and choose `gh-pages` as the branch, and `/docs` as the folder. It will create a link so that you can access the doc online.

NB: the default CI is set up to deploy pages when creating a new tag, but you can update the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.

## Run tests

`pytest`

## Package installation
You can install your package on other environments. Simply move to the root of this project, and run `pip install -e .` to install it with the editable mode. Now, you can import your package when running on this new environment, and it will always consider your code changes thanks to the editable mode (no need to reinstall the package).
