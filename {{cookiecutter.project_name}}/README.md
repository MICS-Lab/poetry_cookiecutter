# Instructions

This project has been generated by cookicutter from [this template](https://github.com/MICS-Lab/poetry_cookiecutter).

## Activate the poetry environment

To activate your new poetry environment, you can choose one of the following:
- Choose the installed poetry interpreter on VSCode (it activate your env automatically at each new terminal window).
- At the root of the project, run `poetry shell`.
- Use `poetry run` before each command line, e.g. `poetry run python your_script.py`

## Run the documentation locally

`mkdocs serve`

## Run tests

`pytest`

## Package installation
You can install your package on other environments. Simply move to the root of this project, and run `pip install -e .` to install it with the editable mode. Now, you can import your package when running on this new environment, and it will always consider your code changes thanks to the editable mode (no need to reinstall the package).
